Repository for the Toy 3 assignment (Isometric View, NPCs) 
The player and a number of NPCs are in a mazelize structure (viewed isometrically from a fixed camera). The player is trying to lure the NPCs into stepping on landmines and/or falling into traps. I am not yet sure if it will be programed in 2D or 3D.
